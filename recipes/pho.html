    <!-- Short Description of Pho -->
    <p>
        Vietnamese pho is <strong>all about the broth!</strong> In this
        authentic recipe, beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger 
        simmer for at least 6 hours, creating a complex, aromatic broth
        that may not be quick, but it's certainly delicious. The 
        flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced 
        beef and topped with fresh garnishes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef Soup Bones:</strong> Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.</li>
        <li><strong>Rice Noodles:</strong> You should be able to find dry rice noodles at most grocery stores, either in the international aisle or another pantry aisle.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it.</li>
        <li><strong>Fish Sauce:</strong> Fish sauce will give the pho a hint of salty, fishy flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> Roast the onions for an extra depth of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings:</strong> This recipe calls for ginger, star anise, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnishes:</strong> Garnish your pho with cilantro, green onion, Thai basil, lime, hoisin sauce, sriracha, or anything else you like.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.</li>
        <li>When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.</li>
        <li>Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
